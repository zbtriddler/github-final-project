I have tried to make it look like the example - i don't care to waste more time messing with it.  Take it or leave it.

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
